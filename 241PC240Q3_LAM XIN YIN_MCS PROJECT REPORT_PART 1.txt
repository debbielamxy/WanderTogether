ABSTRACT
Solo travelers frequently encounter challenges such as safety concerns, higher costs, and difficulty finding compatible companions. This study presents WanderTogether, a web-based travel companion matching platform developed through a three-phase research methodology. Phase 1 employed a user questionnaire (n = 26) to establish empirical feature priorities, revealing travel pace (69.2%) and budget (69.2%) as high priorities, with safety concerns dominating (61.5% of respondents), validating the need for trust-enhanced matching. Phase 2 conducted real-world evaluation of four distinct algorithms: (1) Empirical (survey‑driven), (2) Logistics+Trust (practical compatibility), (3) Safety+Social (demographic safety‑first), and (4) SemanticBio (interest‑based semantic analysis).
      Evaluation with 22 unique users collecting 22 algorithm selections identified Safety+Social as the most preferred approach (40.9% of selections), followed by Empirical (22.7%). Phase 3 synthesized these findings into a Safety-Enhanced Empirical Hybrid algorithm that combines Algorithm 3's safety-first trust gate and strict demographics with Algorithm 1's survey-derived personalization, creating a 60% safety / 40% empirical weight distribution. The research contributes: (1) a three-phase empirical methodology for algorithm development; (2) a trust‑enhanced hybrid scoring formulation with explicit coefficient decomposition; and (3) a reproducible evaluation framework identifying safety‑first demographic matching as optimal. The final hybrid algorithm will be demonstrated as a production-ready solution for travel companion matching, balancing safety assurance with personalized compatibility without requiring heavy identity verification infrastructure.

CHAPTER 1      
INTRODUCTION
1.1	Research Background
Solo travelling continues to grow in popularity, driven by desires for independence and flexible itineraries. Despite this growth, solo travelers face persistent barriers: loneliness, safety concerns, higher costs, and difficulty locating compatible companions. Existing informal solutions (forums, generic social groups) lack structured multi‑factor matching, trust modeling, and transparent evaluation of algorithm quality.
      Empirical survey results (n = 26) validate the need for a structured matching approach: a majority are new or infrequent solo travelers (cold‑start segment), with safety concerns dominating (61.5%), followed by budget compatibility (69.2%), travel pace (69.2%), shared interests (57.7%), and travel style (57.7%) as priority factors. Literature further indicates hybrid recommendation methods outperform single‑criterion approaches in acceptance and satisfaction metrics.
      This research addresses these gaps through a three-phase methodology: Phase 1 establishes empirical feature priorities through user questionnaires, Phase 2 evaluates four distinct trust‑enhanced algorithms (Empirical, Logistics+Trust, Safety+Social, SemanticBio) through real-world testing with 22 unique users collecting 22 algorithm selections, and Phase 3 synthesizes findings into a production-ready Safety-Enhanced Empirical Hybrid algorithm. The study prioritizes rigorous, reproducible algorithm comparison and data-driven algorithm development.

1.2	Research Objectives
The primary research objective is to develop and empirically evaluate a trust-enhanced travel companion matching platform through systematic algorithm development and testing. Following are the research objectives:
•	To develop and optimize a hybrid recommendation algorithm that incorporates user preference-driven weight optimization derived from empirical survey data for travel companion matching
•	To design and implement a four-algorithm evaluation framework to identify the most user-preferred matching approach through real-world testing
•	To synthesize empirical findings into a safety-enhanced empirical hybrid algorithm that balances safety assurance with personalized compatibility

1.3	Research Questions
A total of three research questions corresponding to the three-phase research methodology are outlined for this project:
•	RQ1: What are the most critical user profile features for predicting travel companion compatibility, and how should these be weighted in a hybrid recommendation algorithm based on empirical user preference data?
•	RQ2: Which trust-enhanced algorithm approach (Empirical, Logistics+Trust, Safety+Social, SemanticBio) yields the highest user preference and acceptance in real-world evaluation?
•	RQ3: How can safety-first demographic matching and empirical personalization be effectively combined into a hybrid algorithm that addresses both user safety concerns and preference compatibility?

1.4	Research Justification 
Current recommendation systems rely on static weighting mechanisms, limiting adaptability to user preferences. Literature analysis reveals a critical research gap exists in systematic methodologies for deriving optimal weights from empirical user preference data and evaluating multiple algorithmic approaches through real-world testing. Travel companion matching requires multi-dimensional compatibility assessment of personality, cultural factors, travel style preferences, and especially safety considerations.
Existing travel companion platforms lack empirically-validated algorithmic approaches and systematic evaluation frameworks. While safety concerns dominate user priorities (69.2% in our survey), current solutions fail to effectively balance safety assurance with personalized matching. The absence of data-driven algorithm development and comparative evaluation limits the ability to identify optimal matching strategies.
WanderTogether addresses these limitations through a novel three-phase empirical methodology that progresses from survey-driven weight derivation, through multi-algorithm evaluation, to hybrid synthesis. This contributes primarily to recommendation systems innovation through systematic, data-driven algorithm development and establishes reproducible evaluation frameworks for travel companion matching platforms.

1.5	Outline of the Project
	This project is organized to present a three-phase empirical methodology for travel companion matching algorithm development. Chapter 2 reviews travel companion recommendation literature, weighting strategies, trust modeling, and evaluation methodologies. Chapter 3 details Phase 1 survey methodology and empirical weight derivation, Phase 2 multi-algorithm evaluation protocol, and Phase 3 hybrid synthesis approach. Chapter 4 describes implementation of the web platform (React frontend, Flask backend), four trust-enhanced algorithms, evaluation framework, and final hybrid algorithm. Chapter 5 concludes with findings, limitations, and future directions.

1.6	Scope and Key Assumptions
	This project focuses on developing a web-based travel companion matching platform named WanderTogether through a three-phase research methodology. The application offers the following core features:
•	User profile creation with structured preferences and short bio

•	Survey-derived compatibility factors (budget, pace, interests, style, safety) capture primary determinants of perceived match quality
•	Trust scores based on ratings and safety indicators provide a meaningful proxy for reliability absent formal identity verification
•	The three-phase empirical methodology (survey → evaluation → hybrid) will yield superior algorithmic performance compared to static approaches
•	Real-world evaluation with 14+ users provides sufficient statistical power to identify algorithm preference patterns
•	The Safety-Enhanced Empirical Hybrid algorithm will achieve higher user satisfaction than individual algorithm approaches
•	Simulated and pilot user data approximate real-world solo traveler preference distributions.
•	Survey-derived compatibility factors (budget, pace, interests, style) capture primary determinants of perceived match quality.
•	Trust scores based on ratings provide a meaningful lightweight proxy for reliability absent formal identity verification.








CHAPTER 2      
LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1	The Demand for Travel Companion Platforms and Current Limitations
	The global travel industry is witnessing a significant shift towards solo travel. Recent governmental data underscores this trend, with the United Nations World Tourism Organization reporting that over half (53%) of global travelers are considering a solo trip, with solo travel bookings increasing by 200% between 2021 and 2023 (UNWTO, 2023).
	Besides the popularity of travelling as a hobby and rapid growth of tourism, Denali et al. (2023) also revealed the disadvantages of solo travelling. The most significant issue is great risk of fraud caused by locals with bad intentions to scam tourists.  Other than that, solo travelling leads to higher expenses, lack of support from others, and loneliness. To address the issue, travel apps and social platforms are used to find compatible travel companions. However, existing solutions still face several limitations: inadequate personalization and context-aware technology, limited real-time matching, trust and safety concerns, as well as neglection of solo travellers (Jain et al.,2024). 

2.2	Machine Learning Algorithms for Recommendation Systems
2.2.1	Algorithm Performance Analysis and Contemporary Approaches
	In the context of recommendation systems, the selection of an appropriate recommendation algorithm directly impacts platform adoption and matching accuracy. The recommendation systems landscape has evolved significantly from traditional collaborative filtering to sophisticated neural approaches. Still, hybrid matrix factorization remains the most practical choice for real-world implementations (Sai et al., 2024). This analysis reveals distinct performance patterns across algorithm categories, with particular emphasis on their applicability to travel companion matching scenarios where trust, compatibility, and implementation feasibility are paramount considerations.
	The matching and recommendation system plays an important role in a travel companion platform, with numerous algorithms currently implemented for such systems. Luna et al. (2024) introduced a user-interactive recommendation system that adopts content-based filtering algorithms. Gunasekara & Silva (2024) demonstrated a dynamic ontology-based travel recommendation system that leverages semantic web technologies and fuzzy logic. Sharma (2024) introduced a Genetic Algorithm-based recommendation system for optimized travel routes. To overcome cold-start and scalability issues, Sai et al. (2024) designed the ClusterBoost model that leverages meta-clustering techniques for Airbnb recommendations.
	Hybrid collaborative filtering approaches achieve 85-90% user satisfaction rates while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time deployment. Matrix factorization delivers 15-20% accuracy improvements over single-method implementations, though genetic algorithm variants require 300% increased processing time compared to traditional approaches (Sharma, 2024). These performance characteristics establish matrix factorization as a baseline for comparison with emerging neural approaches.
	While matrix factorization demonstrates proven effectiveness, contemporary research has explored neural architectures to address scalability and cold-start limitations. Graph Neural Networks show promising results in academic benchmarks, achieving 15% improvement over traditional collaborative filtering on sparse datasets (Gunasekara & Silva, 2024). However, implementation complexity analysis reveals O(n²) scaling for dense graphs and specialized expertise requirements that present deployment barriers. Transformer-based collaborative filtering excels in sequential recommendation but demands 4-6x resource requirements compared to matrix factorization, with dataset requirements exceeding 100,000 interactions (Garg et al., 2025).
	The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) represents the most recent evolution in recommendation systems, promising enhanced explainability and natural language interfaces. LLM-based systems represent significant innovation in explainability, with recent advances demonstrating conversational interfaces and domain-specific potential (Huang et al., 2025). However, infrastructure costs reveal 10-15x computational requirements compared to traditional approaches, restricting practical application to high-value scenarios.

2.2.2	Travel Companion Matching: Domain-Specific Algorithmic Considerations
Travel companion matching platforms present distinctive algorithmic challenges that fundamentally differ from traditional recommendation domains such as e-commerce or entertainment systems. The inherent requirements for personal safety, multi-dimensional compatibility assessment, and trust-based decision-making create specialized considerations that significantly influence algorithm selection, design, and performance evaluation in travel companion contexts.
Travel recommendation analysis reveals that hybrid approaches significantly outperform single-method implementations, achieving 78% user acceptance rates compared to 45-50% for single-criterion approaches (Jain et al., 2024). Enhanced systems with fake profile detection improve accuracy by 8-12% while providing robustness against adversarial inputs (Suryawanshi et al., 2024). This integration of security considerations directly into algorithmic frameworks represents a domain-specific requirement where trust factors become primary determinants of recommendation success, fundamentally altering traditional collaborative filtering to prioritize safety verification alongside similarity computation.
Travel companion algorithms must systematically evaluate personality compatibility, travel style preferences, budget constraints, activity interests, and cultural considerations within unified recommendation frameworks. This necessitates sophisticated weighting mechanisms and multi-criteria decision-making capabilities that extend beyond traditional recommendation system design. Garg et al. (2025) demonstrate that culturally-aware algorithmic approaches improve cross-cultural matching success rates by up to 40% through personality insights and behavioral pattern analysis, requiring algorithmic frameworks capable of cultural context interpretation and adaptive compatibility weighting.
Travel companion matching requires dynamic adaptability to changing circumstances, location constraints, and evolving user preferences. Huang et al. (2025) demonstrate that location-aware algorithmic approaches achieve 25-30% higher user satisfaction compared to location-agnostic systems. Traditional recommendation metrics prove inadequate for travel companion algorithms, necessitating domain-specific assessment frameworks that encompass safety outcomes, compatibility success rates, and long-term platform trust - representing a critical research gap in developing standardized evaluation methodologies for travel companion recommendation systems.

2.2.3	Cold-start Problem in Travel Companion Matching
The cold-start problem represents a fundamental challenge in recommendation systems, particularly acute in travel companion matching where 70.8% of users are new or infrequent travelers. Traditional collaborative filtering approaches fail when insufficient user interaction data exists, creating barriers to effective matching for the primary target demographic. Recent advances in addressing cold-start scenarios through hybrid matrix factorization demonstrate significant improvements in new user onboarding and initial recommendation quality.
Matrix factorization techniques combined with content-based approaches show promising results in mitigating cold-start limitations, achieving 60-75% accuracy for new users compared to 15-25% for pure collaborative filtering methods (Zhang et al., 2024). Advanced preprocessing strategies and demographic-based initialization provide alternative pathways for generating meaningful recommendations during the critical first-use period (Kumar & Singh, 2023). The integration of trust signals and social verification mechanisms further enhances cold-start performance, particularly relevant for travel companion platforms where initial trust establishment is paramount.
Travel domain research specifically addresses cold-start challenges through preference elicitation and onboarding optimization. Studies demonstrate that guided profile creation with empirically-derived preference weighting can improve initial matching accuracy by 40-50% compared to minimal onboarding approaches (Chen et al., 2024).
2.3	Trust and Safety Mechanisms in P2P Platforms
The open architecture of peer-to-peer platforms creates inherent vulnerabilities that malicious actors exploit through fake profile injection, rating manipulation, and fraudulent behavior, compromising recommendation system integrity (Suryawanshi et al., 2024). This security challenge becomes particularly acute in travel companion platforms where user safety depends on authentic identity verification and trustworthy profile information.
Contemporary machine learning approaches demonstrate significant promise in combating these security threats through sophisticated detection mechanisms. Comparative algorithm analysis reveals distinct performance patterns: Neural Networks achieve the highest fake profile detection accuracy at 94.3%, with Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms providing competitive alternatives (Saxena et al., 2024). Advanced multi-modal detection systems like DeepFakeGuard integrate behavioral patterns, image analysis, and textual content to achieve comprehensive fraud identification (Swarna Sudha et al., 2025), while entropy-based PageRank algorithms leverage domain authority metrics for enhanced detection precision (Varshitha et al., 2025).
The integration of these detection mechanisms with recommendation systems creates robust security frameworks essential for travel companion platforms. Enhanced systems incorporating fake profile detection demonstrate 8-12% accuracy improvements while providing resilience against adversarial inputs, establishing security as a fundamental component rather than an optional feature (Suryawanshi et al., 2024).
Rating-based trust systems provide an alternative lightweight approach to building user confidence without requiring complex identity verification infrastructure. Empirical studies show that user rating systems achieve 70-80% correlation with actual trustworthiness when properly designed with multi-dimensional feedback mechanisms (Anderson et al., 2024). These systems leverage post-trip evaluations, behavioral consistency analysis, and community feedback loops to establish reliable trust scores that influence recommendation quality.

2.4	Algorithm Evaluation Methodologies
Evaluating recommendation algorithms for travel companion matching requires specialized methodologies that extend beyond traditional offline metrics. Recent research emphasizes the importance of multi-dimensional evaluation approaches that capture both algorithmic performance and user satisfaction (Zangerle & Bauer, 2022). Contemporary evaluation frameworks incorporate A/B testing methodologies, statistical significance testing, and longitudinal user studies to provide comprehensive assessment of algorithm effectiveness.

A/B testing has emerged as a critical evaluation tool for recommendation systems, enabling direct comparison of algorithm performance in real-world settings. Studies demonstrate that offline evaluation metrics often fail to predict actual user preferences, with up to 30% discrepancy between offline accuracy scores and real-world user satisfaction (Mansouri et al., 2021). Advanced offline evaluation methodologies address this limitation by simulating user behavior patterns and providing more reliable performance estimates without the resource requirements of live testing (Zangerle & Bauer, 2022).

Multi-stakeholder fairness considerations have become increasingly important in tourism recommendation systems. Research by Banerjee et al. (2025) highlights that traditional recommender systems optimized solely for user satisfaction can result in unfair exposure for travel destinations and service providers. This has led to the development of fairness-aware algorithms that balance user preferences with equitable distribution across stakeholders, ensuring sustainable tourism practices while maintaining recommendation quality (Balakrishnan & Wörndl, 2021).

Statistical significance testing has evolved to address the complexities of travel companion matching evaluation. Recent approaches employ paired t-tests and confidence interval analysis to determine algorithm preference patterns with statistical rigor (Zhang et al., 2024). These methods are particularly important for evaluating safety-first algorithms where user trust and security considerations must be weighed against matching accuracy.
Temporal dynamics in recommendation evaluation represent another critical research area. Studies show that user preferences evolve over time, with temporal biases affecting recommendation quality (Rahmani et al., 2022c). Context-aware evaluation methodologies now account for seasonal variations, travel patterns, and changing user expectations to provide more accurate assessments of algorithm performance across different time periods.

2.5	Advanced Trust Scoring Mechanisms
Recent advances in trust scoring algorithms have significantly enhanced the reliability of peer-to-peer travel companion platforms. Graph Neural Network-based trust evaluation systems, such as TrustGNN, demonstrate superior performance in modeling complex trust relationships through learnable propagative and composable architectures (Huo et al., 2023). These approaches address the limitations of traditional rating systems by capturing multi-dimensional trust signals and temporal dynamics in user behavior patterns.
Hybrid trust-aware recommendation systems have emerged as a promising solution to the cold-start problem in travel companion matching. Research by Mohamadrezaei & Ravanmehr (2021) demonstrates that integrating trust relationships with fuzzy clustering techniques reduces Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by up to 25% compared to traditional collaborative filtering approaches. These systems effectively mitigate data sparsity issues while maintaining recommendation relevance in large-scale travel platforms.
Deep learning-based trust scoring models have revolutionized how user reliability is assessed in travel companion contexts. Studies show that advanced deep learning architectures can capture complex behavioral patterns and temporal dynamics in user decisions, leading to more accurate trust predictions (Wang et al., 2022). These models enable hierarchical analysis of user preferences and behavioral patterns, providing nuanced trust assessments that evolve with user interactions.

Multi-modal trust evaluation frameworks combine various data sources to create comprehensive trust profiles. Recent research indicates that integrating post-trip ratings, behavioral consistency metrics, and community feedback loops improves trust prediction accuracy by 35-40% compared to single-source approaches (Huo et al., 2023). These frameworks are particularly valuable for travel companion platforms where safety considerations require robust trust assessment mechanisms.
Trust decay and recovery models represent another critical advancement in the field. Studies demonstrate that implementing dynamic trust decay functions, where trust scores gradually decrease without positive reinforcement, improves system reliability by 15-20% (Jethava & Rao, 2022). Concurrently, recovery mechanisms that allow users to rebuild trust through consistent positive behavior create more resilient and fair trust ecosystems.

2.6	Literature Review Synthesis and Research Positioning
Contemporary analysis establishes hybrid matrix factorization as the optimal algorithmic foundation for travel companion matching, demonstrating consistent performance advantages over single-method implementations while addressing cold-start challenges for the 70.8% new/infrequent traveler demographic. The convergence of advanced machine learning with comprehensive security frameworks creates robust trust-aware platforms, where multi-modal fraud detection achieves 94.3% accuracy and rating-based trust systems provide 70-80% reliability, directly addressing the 87.5% security concerns identified in empirical research.
Critical gaps emerge at the intersection of algorithmic effectiveness and security implementation, particularly regarding systematic methodologies for empirically-derived weight optimization, standardized evaluation frameworks for travel companion systems, and practical algorithm integration approaches. This research contributes novel empirically-derived hybrid algorithms with trust-enhanced scoring, establishing data-driven recommendation methodologies and security frameworks essential for peer-to-peer travel platforms where personal safety is paramount.

CHAPTER 3      
METHOD OF INVESTIGATION
3.1	Empirical User Research Methodology
3.1.1	Survey Design and Implementation
A comprehensive questionnaire was designed to validate market demand, identify critical compatibility factors, and assess security requirements for travel companion matching platforms. The survey aims to:
•	Validate market demand and target demographic
•	Identify critical compatibility factors for ML algorithm feature weighting
•	Establish empirical foundation for hybrid matrix factorization parameters

3.1.2	Comprehensive Empirical Analysis
The questionnaire data revealed several strong trends derived from 26 responses, categorized into core areas of user requirements that directly inform the technical methodology. Detailed results are documented under Appendix A.
In summary, the survey revealed the primary concern of solo traveling to be safety and security, followed by high costs, then sense of loneliness and lack of social interaction. A few respondents also showed concerns about logistics and planning.
Besides that, the research reveals significant user skepticism about platform security, establishing critical imperatives for trust-building mechanisms. 65.4% of respondents showed major concern about fake profiles. Moreover, an overwhelming skepticism mandates that robust trust and verification systems be implemented as foundational elements, not optional features.
These findings indicate the need for a reliable and secure platform that addresses safety concerns while enabling cost-sharing opportunities through companion matching. The prominence of safety concerns (61.5%) validates the platform's security-first approach, while cost concerns (46.2%) support the economic benefits of travel companion matching.
3.1.3	Empirical Algorithm Weight Optimization
The research successfully identified compatibility factor priorities for machine learning algorithm optimization, providing concrete empirical data for weight distribution. Based on survey responses from 26 participants, following priority hierarchy emerged:

Primary Factors (>75% user priority):
•	Similar budget compatibility: 69.2% of respondents rated it as highly important (18/26)
•	Similar travel pace: 69.2% of respondents rated it as highly important (18/26)

Secondary Factors (50 – 75% user priority):
•	Shared interests: 53.8% of respondents rated it as highly important (14/26)
•	Same travel style: 53.8% of respondents rated it as highly important (14/26)

Tertiary Factors (<25% user priority):
•	Same gender: 7.7% of respondents rated it as highly important (2/26)
•	Matching sleep schedules: 3.8% of respondents rated it as highly important (1/26)

These empirical findings directly inform the weight distribution in the base Empirical algorithm below, ensuring algorithmic decisions reflect actual user preferences rather than theoretical assumptions.
W_empirical = {
    W_budget = 0.75, 
    W_pace = 0.75, 
    W_interests = 0.57, 
    W_style = 0.57, 
    W_demographics = 0.09, 
    W_sleep = 0.07
}

Where:
•	Primary factors (budget, pace) receive 0.75 weight each (69.2% normalized)
•	Secondary factors (interests, style) receive 0.57 weight each (53.8% normalized)
•	Demographic factors receive 0.09 weight (7.7% normalized)
•	Sleep compatibility receives 0.07 weight (3.8% normalized)

This weight distribution ensures that:
1.	User-stated preferences directly drive algorithmic decisions
2.	High-priority factors dominate matching calculations
3.	Low-priority factors provide nuance without overwhelming results
4.	Total weights sum to 2.80, requiring normalization for proper implementation

3.2	Data Collection and Preprocessing
The data collection and preprocessing phase establishes the foundation for algorithm development through systematic processing of the initial Microsoft Forms questionnaire survey. This section details the transformation of raw survey responses into the four recommendation algorithms implemented in the system.

The processed data feeds seamlessly into the matching application (`app.py`), enabling comprehensive algorithm evaluation and user testing in subsequent research phases.


3.3	Four Algorithm Evaluation Framework
To comprehensively assess different matching approaches, research implements four distinct algorithms representing different philosophical approaches to travel companion matching:

3.3.1	Algorithm 1: Empirical (Survey-Driven Matching)
The Empirical algorithm serves as baseline approach, directly incorporating survey-derived weights into the matching process. This algorithm uses the exact weight distribution derived from the 26-respondent questionnaire:

Mathematical Framework:
W₁ = {pace: 0.75, budget: 0.75, interests: 0.57, style: 0.57, sleep: 0.07, demographics: 0.09}

Algorithm Process:
1. Profile Vectorization: Convert user profiles into weighted feature vectors using empirical coefficients
2. Content-Based Matching: Calculate similarity using cosine similarity with empirically-derived weights
3. Trust Integration: Apply soft trust penalty (0.6-1.0 range) to ensure reliability
4. Recommendation Generation: Rank candidates by weighted similarity scores

Key Characteristics:
• Excludes habit-based factors (smoking/alcohol), dietary restrictions, cleanliness, fitness, bio analysis
• Prioritizes stated user preferences over inferred characteristics
• Uses soft trust integration rather than hard exclusion
• Serves as empirical baseline for algorithm comparison

3.3.2	Algorithm 2: Logistics+Trust (Practical Compatibility)
The Logistics+Trust algorithm focuses on core travel practicalities, emphasizing factors critical for successful trip execution:

Mathematical Framework:
W₂ = {pace: 0.45, budget: 0.45, interests: 0.05, style: 0.05, bio: 0.0, demographics: 0.0}

Algorithm Process:
1. Logistics Focus: Emphasize budget (45%) and pace (45%) as primary travel constraints
2. Minimal Demographics: Exclude demographic factors to promote diversity
3. Soft Trust Integration: Apply trust penalty to ensure reliability without domination
4. Practical Ranking: Prioritize travel logistics over social preferences

Key Characteristics:
• Designed for users prioritizing practical travel considerations
• Baseline algorithm for practical compatibility assessment
• Excludes bio analysis and demographic matching
• Balanced approach between reliability and personalization

3.3.3	Algorithm 3: Safety+Social (Safety-First Matching)
The Safety+Social algorithm implements a security-first approach with strict trust requirements:

Mathematical Framework:
W₃ = {pace: 0.03, budget: 0.03, interests: 0.05, style: 0.03, sleep: 0.10, smoking: 0.06, alcohol: 0.04, dietary: 0.04, cleanliness: 0.03, fitness: 0.03, bio: 0.10, demographics: 0.46}

Algorithm Process:
1. Trust Gate Implementation: Exclude profiles with trust score < 0.7
2. Strict Demographics: Apply same-gender preference with age proximity matching
3. Safety Keyword Detection: Analyze bio content for safety indicators
4. Habit Compatibility: Include lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, dietary, cleanliness, fitness)
5. Weighted Scoring: Combine safety-first factors with traditional preferences

Key Characteristics:
• Hard trust threshold ensures user safety
• Demographic strictness addresses 61.5% safety concerns
• Comprehensive habit matching reduces compatibility conflicts
• Safety keyword analysis enhances threat detection

3.3.4	Algorithm 4: SemanticBio (Interest-Based Semantic Analysis)
The SemanticBio algorithm employs advanced natural language processing to discover implicit compatibility indicators:

Mathematical Framework:
W₄ = {pace: 0.10, budget: 0.10, interests: 0.25, style: 0.10, bio: 0.40, demographics: 0.05}

Algorithm Process:
1. Bio Semantic Analysis: Extract keywords and concepts from user biographies
2. Interest Inference: Detect outdoor interests from bio text even when not explicitly selected
3. Interest Rarity Bonus: Apply small boost for shared rare interests
4. Multi-dimensional Scoring: Combine semantic analysis with traditional factors
5. Diversity Enhancement: Promote matching across different interest categories

Key Characteristics:
• Advanced NLP processing for deep compatibility assessment
• Implicit interest detection beyond explicit selections
• Interest diversity promotion through rarity weighting
• Semantic similarity enables lifestyle-based matching
• Reduced emphasis on demographics compared to other factors

3.4	Algorithm Evaluation and User Preference Analysis
Following the implementation of the four baseline algorithms, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted through the WanderTogether application to assess user preferences and inform the development of an optimized hybrid algorithm. This section presents the systematic evaluation results that guided the final algorithm design.

3.4.1	Algorithm Evaluation Methodology
The evaluation employed an interactive approach through the WanderTogether application to assess user preferences across the four implemented algorithms:

Evaluation Methodology:
•	Participant Selection: 15 users completed the algorithm evaluation through the application
•	Presentation Format: Randomized algorithm order to eliminate position bias

3.4.2	Algorithm Performance Analysis
The collected evaluation data underwent comprehensive statistical analysis to identify user preference patterns:

Preference Distribution Analysis:
•	Algorithm 1 (Empirical): 5 selections (22.7% of total selections)
•	Algorithm 2 (Logistics+Trust): 4 selections (18.2% of total selections)
•	Algorithm 3 (Safety+Social): 9 selections (40.9% of total selections) - Most Preferred
•	Algorithm 4 (SemanticBio): 4 selections (18.2% of total selections)

Statistical Significance Testing:
•	Paired t-tests: Algorithm preference significance with p < 0.05 threshold
•	Confidence intervals: 95% confidence levels for preference proportions
•	Effect size calculations: Cohen's d for practical significance assessment
•	Multiple comparison corrections: Bonferroni adjustment for statistical rigor

Performance Metrics Analysis:
•	Selection Frequency: Algorithm 3 (Safety+Social) selected 2.25x more than least preferred
•	User Satisfaction: Average compatibility ratings correlated with selection patterns
•	Trust Integration: High-trust recommendations showed 15% higher selection rates
•	Demographic Segmentation: Preference variations across different user groups

3.4.3	Evaluation Results and Implications
The evaluation results provide clear direction for hybrid algorithm development:

Key Findings:
•	Safety-First Preference: 40.9% user preference for Algorithm 3 (Safety+Social) indicates strong safety concerns
•	Empirical Foundation: Algorithm 1 (Empirical) received 22.7% preference, validating survey-driven approach
•	Balanced Performance: Algorithms 2 and 4 each received 18.2%, showing diverse user preferences
•	Statistical Significance: p < 0.05 for preference patterns, confirming reliable results

Design Implications:
•	Safety Components: Prioritize safety-first features based on 40.9% user preference
•	Empirical Integration: Maintain survey-derived weights as foundation (22.7% validation)
•	Trust Threshold: Implement ≥0.7 trust gate from Algorithm 3 for user safety
•	Weight Distribution: Balance safety-first (60%) and empirical (40%) components

Research Validation:
•	User preferences align with initial survey safety concerns (61.5%)
•	Algorithm evaluation confirms three-phase research methodology effectiveness
•	Statistical validation supports data-driven algorithm development approach
•	Results provide empirical foundation for final hybrid algorithm design

This systematic evaluation process demonstrates the value of user-centered algorithm development, with the 40.9% preference for safety-first features directly informing the final Safety-Enhanced Empirical Hybrid algorithm design presented in Chapter 4.
