ABSTRACT
      Solo travelers frequently encounter challenges such as safety concerns, higher costs, and difficulty finding compatible companions. This study presents WanderTogether, a web-based travel companion matching platform centered on the empirical evaluation of four fixed trust‑enhanced hybrid recommendation algorithms. Each algorithm combines content similarity (survey‑derived feature weight variants), collaborative distance, and a dynamic user trust score derived from ratings and willingness indicators, with one variant enriched by lightweight bio keyword semantics and a cold‑start fallback strategy.
      A user survey (n = 24) establishes empirical feature priorities (budget, travel pace, shared interests, travel style) which seed the baseline weighting configuration. Three alternative configurations systematically reallocate emphasis (logistics + trust, experiential engagement, semantic bio overlap) while remaining fixed throughout evaluation to preserve experimental validity. A controlled exposure design recommends a balanced set of candidate profiles per algorithm to each participant; collected 4-level labeled ratings (1=Bad, 2=Neutral, 3=Good, 4=Very Good) and “would travel” signals form the quantitative basis for comparison.
      The research contributes: (1) a trust‑enhanced hybrid scoring formulation with explicit coefficient decomposition; (2) a reproducible evaluation protocol (rating distribution, mean acceptance, score–rating calibration, cold‑start performance); and (3) empirical findings identifying the most user‑preferred weighting strategy for perceived compatibility. Results inform practical guidance for designing transparent, user‑centric travel companion matchers without reliance on heavy identity verification infrastructure. Blockchain identity verification is scoped as future work rather than core contribution, allowing deeper rigor on algorithmic evaluation and trust modeling.

CHAPTER 1       
INTRODUCTION
1.1 Research Background
      Solo travelling continues to grow in popularity, driven by desires for independence and flexible itineraries. Despite this growth, solo travelers face persistent barriers: loneliness, safety concerns, higher costs, and difficulty locating compatible companions. Existing informal solutions (forums, generic social groups) lack structured multi‑factor matching, trust modeling, and transparent evaluation of algorithm quality.
      Empirical survey results (n = 24) validate the need for a structured matching approach: a majority are new or infrequent solo travelers (cold‑start segment), with budget compatibility, travel pace, shared interests, and travel style emerging as priority factors. Literature further indicates hybrid recommendation methods outperform single‑criterion approaches in acceptance and satisfaction metrics.
      This research addresses these gaps by developing WanderTogether—an evaluation platform implementing four fixed trust‑enhanced hybrid algorithms. Each algorithm combines empirically‑weighted content similarity, collaborative distance, and a rating‑derived trust component; one variant extends matching through short bio keyword overlap. Rather than integrating blockchain identity verification (scoped for future work), the study prioritizes rigorous, reproducible algorithm comparison and trust score impact analysis.
      
1.2 Research Objectives
      The primary goal is to develop and empirically evaluate trust‑enhanced hybrid algorithms for travel companion matching. The specific objectives are:
* O1: Implement a platform supporting four fixed hybrid algorithm configurations derived from empirical feature priorities (baseline, logistics+trust emphasis, experiential alignment, semantic bio enrichment).
* O2: Design and integrate a rating‑driven trust score model influencing hybrid ranking without altering fixed feature weights.
* O3: Establish and execute a controlled multi‑algorithm exposure protocol measuring user ratings, acceptance (would travel), and score–rating calibration including cold‑start performance.
* O4: Produce an evaluation framework and selection guidelines for choosing the most user‑preferred weighting strategy in travel companion matching contexts.

1.3 Research Questions
      The study investigates the following research questions:
* RQ1: Which fixed trust‑enhanced hybrid weighting configuration yields the highest perceived compatibility and acceptance among solo travelers?
* RQ2: How do user rating‑derived trust scores influence ranking quality and visibility across algorithms, particularly for cold‑start users?
* RQ3: Does semantic bio keyword enrichment measurably improve early perceived match quality compared to purely structured feature weighting?
      
1.4 Research Justification 
      Existing travel companion solutions lack empirically validated multi‑factor weighting strategies and transparent comparative evaluation. There is a research gap in reproducible protocols for assessing user‑perceived compatibility across alternative hybrid weighting designs while incorporating trust signals derived from ratings. Trust modeling—distinct from cryptographic identity verification—offers a lightweight mechanism to influence ranking fairness and user visibility. By fixing algorithm variants and isolating trust evolution, this study delivers credible evidence on weighting effectiveness, calibration, and cold‑start robustness. Identity verification via blockchain is acknowledged as valuable future work but excluded to allow deeper methodological rigor within a constrained project scope.
      WanderTogether addresses these limitations through novel empirically-derived hybrid matrix factorization integrated with blockchain verification, contributing primarily to recommendation systems innovation while establishing secure user authentication frameworks for social matching platforms.
1.5 Outline of the Project
      This project is organized to present empirical evaluation of fixed hybrid algorithms. Chapter 2 reviews travel companion recommendation literature, weighting strategies, trust/rating modeling, cold‑start handling, and semantic enrichment. Chapter 3 details survey methodology, feature engineering, trust score formulation, and evaluation protocol design. Chapter 4 describes implementation of the web platform (React frontend, Flask backend), four hybrid algorithms, exposure generation, and data logging for analysis. Chapter 5 concludes with findings, limitations (including deferred identity verification), and future directions.

1.6 Scope and Key Assumptions
	This project focuses on developing a web-based travel companion matching platform (WanderTogether) supporting empirical evaluation of four fixed trust‑enhanced hybrid algorithms. Core features:
* User profile creation with structured preferences and short bio (keyword extraction)
* Fixed hybrid recommendation variants (content + collaborative + trust; one with bio semantics)
* Rating submission and trust score evolution
* Controlled multi‑algorithm exposure for evaluation (no booking or itinerary management)
      Blockchain-based identity verification, advanced fraud detection, and full messaging are explicitly out of scope and identified as future enhancement areas.
      Meanwhile, following key assumptions underpin the design, implementation, and evaluation of this project:
* Simulated and pilot user data approximate real-world solo traveler preference distributions.
* Survey-derived compatibility factors (budget, pace, interests, style) capture primary determinants of perceived match quality.
* Trust scores based on ratings provide a meaningful lightweight proxy for reliability absent formal identity verification.
* Fixed hybrid weighting plus trust enhancement improves recommendation relevance over single-component baselines.








CHAPTER 2       
LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 The Demand for Travel Companion Platforms and Current Limitations
	The global travel industry is witnessing a significant shift towards solo travel. Recent market data underscores this trend, with a report indicating that over half (53%) of global travelers are considering a solo trip (Booking.com, 2023). The demand has surged dramatically, with search data showing a 200% increase in queries for single-occupancy flights between 2021 and 2023 (VacationRenter, 2023).
	Besides the popularity of travelling as a hobby and rapid growth of tourism, Denali et al. (2023) also revealed the disadvantages of solo travelling. The most significant issue is great risk of fraud caused by locals with bad intentions to scam tourists.  Other than that, solo travelling leads to higher expenses, lack of support from others, and loneliness. To address the issue, travel apps and social platforms are used to find compatible travel companions. However, existing solutions still face several limitations: inadequate personalization and context-aware technology, limited real-time matching, trust and safety concerns, as well as neglection of solo travellers (Jain et al.,2024). 

2.2 Machine Learning Algorithms for Recommendation Systems
2.2.1 Algorithm Performance Analysis and Contemporary Approaches
	In the context of recommendation systems, the selection of an appropriate recommendation algorithm directly impacts platform adoption and matching accuracy. The recommendation systems landscape has evolved significantly from traditional collaborative filtering to sophisticated neural approaches. Still, hybrid matrix factorization remains the most practical choice for real-world implementations (Sai et al., 2024). This analysis reveals distinct performance patterns across algorithm categories, with particular emphasis on their applicability to travel companion matching scenarios where trust, compatibility, and implementation feasibility are paramount considerations.
	The matching and recommendation system plays an important role in a travel companion platform, with numerous algorithms currently implemented for such systems. Luna et al. (2024) introduced a user-interactive recommendation system that adopts content-based filtering algorithms. Gunasekara & Silva (2024) demonstrated a dynamic ontology-based travel recommendation system that leverages semantic web technologies and fuzzy logic. Sharma (2024) introduced a Genetic Algorithm-based recommendation system for optimized travel routes. To overcome cold-start and scalability issues, Sai et al. (2024) designed the ClusterBoost model that leverages meta-clustering techniques for Airbnb recommendations.
	Hybrid collaborative filtering approaches achieve 85-90% user satisfaction rates while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time deployment. Matrix factorization delivers 15-20% accuracy improvements over single-method implementations, though genetic algorithm variants require 300% increased processing time compared to traditional approaches (Sharma, 2024). These performance characteristics establish matrix factorization as a baseline for comparison with emerging neural approaches.
	While matrix factorization demonstrates proven effectiveness, contemporary research has explored neural architectures to address scalability and cold-start limitations. Graph Neural Networks show promising results in academic benchmarks, achieving 15% improvement over traditional collaborative filtering on sparse datasets (Gunasekara & Silva, 2024). However, implementation complexity analysis reveals O(n�) scaling for dense graphs and specialized expertise requirements that present deployment barriers. Transformer-based collaborative filtering excels in sequential recommendation but demands 4-6x resource requirements compared to matrix factorization, with dataset requirements exceeding 100,000 interactions (Garg et al., 2025).
	The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) represents the most recent evolution in recommendation systems, promising enhanced explainability and natural language interfaces. LLM-based systems represent significant innovation in explainability, with recent advances demonstrating conversational interfaces and domain-specific potential (Huang et al., 2025). However, infrastructure costs reveal 10-15x computational requirements compared to traditional approaches, restricting practical application to high-value scenarios.
      
2.2.2 Travel Companion Matching: Domain-Specific Algorithmic Considerations
      Travel companion matching platforms present distinctive algorithmic challenges that fundamentally differ from traditional recommendation domains such as e-commerce or entertainment systems. The inherent requirements for personal safety, multi-dimensional compatibility assessment, and trust-based decision-making create specialized considerations that significantly influence algorithm selection, design, and performance evaluation in travel companion contexts.
      Travel recommendation analysis reveals that hybrid approaches significantly outperform single-method implementations, achieving 78% user acceptance rates compared to 45-50% for single-criterion approaches (Jain et al., 2024). Enhanced systems with fake profile detection improve accuracy by 8-12% while providing robustness against adversarial inputs (Suryawanshi et al., 2024). This integration of security considerations directly into algorithmic frameworks represents a domain-specific requirement where trust factors become primary determinants of recommendation success, fundamentally altering traditional collaborative filtering to prioritize safety verification alongside similarity computation.
      Travel companion algorithms must systematically evaluate personality compatibility, travel style preferences, budget constraints, activity interests, and cultural considerations within unified recommendation frameworks. This necessitates sophisticated weighting mechanisms and multi-criteria decision-making capabilities that extend beyond traditional recommendation system design. Garg et al. (2025) demonstrate that culturally-aware algorithmic approaches improve cross-cultural matching success rates by up to 40% through personality insights and behavioral pattern analysis, requiring algorithmic frameworks capable of cultural context interpretation and adaptive compatibility weighting.
      Travel companion matching requires dynamic adaptability to changing circumstances, location constraints, and evolving user preferences. Huang et al. (2025) demonstrate that location-aware algorithmic approaches achieve 25-30% higher user satisfaction compared to location-agnostic systems. Traditional recommendation metrics prove inadequate for travel companion algorithms, necessitating domain-specific assessment frameworks that encompass safety outcomes, compatibility success rates, and long-term platform trust - representing a critical research gap in developing standardized evaluation methodologies for travel companion recommendation systems.

2.2.3 Cold-start Problem in Travel Companion Matching
      The cold-start problem represents a fundamental challenge in recommendation systems, particularly acute in travel companion matching where 70.8% of users are new or infrequent travelers. Traditional collaborative filtering approaches fail when insufficient user interaction data exists, creating barriers to effective matching for the primary target demographic. Recent advances in addressing cold-start scenarios through hybrid matrix factorization demonstrate significant improvements in new user onboarding and initial recommendation quality.
      Matrix factorization techniques combined with content-based approaches show promising results in mitigating cold-start limitations, achieving 60-75% accuracy for new users compared to 15-25% for pure collaborative filtering methods (Zhang et al., 2024). Advanced preprocessing strategies and demographic-based initialization provide alternative pathways for generating meaningful recommendations during the critical first-use period (Kumar & Singh, 2023). The integration of trust signals and social verification mechanisms further enhances cold-start performance, particularly relevant for travel companion platforms where initial trust establishment is paramount.
      Travel domain research specifically addresses cold-start challenges through preference elicitation and onboarding optimization. Studies demonstrate that guided profile creation with empirically-derived preference weighting can improve initial matching accuracy by 40-50% compared to minimal onboarding approaches (Chen et al., 2024).

2.3 Trust and Safety Mechanisms in P2P Platforms
      The open architecture of peer-to-peer platforms creates inherent vulnerabilities that malicious actors exploit through fake profile injection, rating manipulation, and fraudulent behavior, compromising recommendation system integrity (Suryawanshi et al., 2024). This security challenge becomes particularly acute in travel companion platforms where user safety depends on authentic identity verification and trustworthy profile information.
      Contemporary machine learning approaches demonstrate significant promise in combating these security threats through sophisticated detection mechanisms. Comparative algorithm analysis reveals distinct performance patterns: Neural Networks achieve the highest fake profile detection accuracy at 94.3%, with Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms providing competitive alternatives (Saxena et al., 2024). Advanced multi-modal detection systems like DeepFakeGuard integrate behavioral patterns, image analysis, and textual content to achieve comprehensive fraud identification (Swarna Sudha et al., 2025), while entropy-based PageRank algorithms leverage domain authority metrics for enhanced detection precision (Varshitha et al., 2025).
      The integration of these detection mechanisms with recommendation systems creates robust security frameworks essential for travel companion platforms. Enhanced systems incorporating fake profile detection demonstrate 8-12% accuracy improvements while providing resilience against adversarial inputs, establishing security as a fundamental component rather than an optional feature (Suryawanshi et al., 2024). 
      
2.4 Blockchain-Based Identity Verification and Decentralized Trust
      Blockchain technology's immutable, decentralized architecture provides fundamental security guarantees-integrity, transparency, and tamper-resistance-that address critical trust deficits in peer-to-peer platforms. The convergence of blockchain-based identity verification with machine learning-driven fraud detection creates comprehensive security frameworks specifically suited to travel companions matching requirements.
      Recent implementations demonstrate the practical viability of hybrid blockchain-ML approaches for identity management. Budhathoki et al. (2025) presents a dual-component system combining blockchain-secured data storage with user-friendly interfaces, while Pokharel et al. (2025) integrate blockchain credential protection with continuous behavioral analysis for real-time fraud detection. This dual-layered approach ensures certification immutability while enabling dynamic threat assessment through machine learning algorithms.
      Empirical analysis of decentralized identity implementations reveals superior performance metrics compared to traditional centralized approaches. Blockchain-based verification systems achieve 95-98% accuracy while eliminating single points of failure inherent in centralized architectures (Rodriguez et al., 2024). Advanced smart contract protocols enable automated trust scoring that adapts to user interaction patterns, providing dynamic security assessments particularly suitable for travel platforms where trust requirements vary by trip characteristics (Thompson & Liu, 2023).
      Platform deployment analysis demonstrates the practical effectiveness of blockchain identity verification in real-world scenarios. Systems implementing comprehensive blockchain verification report 85-90% user confidence ratings and 60-70% reduction in fraudulent incidents compared to traditional approaches (Anderson et al., 2024). The implementation of Soulbound Tokens specifically addresses non-transferable credential requirements essential for personal identity confirmation, directly supporting the WanderTogether platform's security architecture where 75% of users demand government ID verification.
      Despite these advantages, blockchain-based identity management faces implementation challenges including interoperability limitations, scalability constraints, and regulatory compliance requirements. Critical vulnerabilities include private key security dependencies, smart contract capacity limitations, and potential metadata analysis exposure (Diwan et al., 2025). However, ongoing research demonstrates that these challenges can be addressed through interdisciplinary collaboration and systematic security framework development (Tabbassum et al., 2024).

2.5 Literature Review Synthesis and Research Positioning
      Contemporary analysis establishes hybrid matrix factorization as the optimal algorithmic foundation for travel companion matching, demonstrating consistent performance advantages over single-method implementations while addressing cold-start challenges for the 70.8% new/infrequent traveler demographic. The convergence of advanced machine learning with comprehensive security frameworks creates robust trust-aware platforms, where multi-modal fraud detection achieves 94.3% accuracy and blockchain verification demonstrates 95-98% accuracy, directly addressing the 87.5% security concerns identified in empirical research.
      Critical gaps emerge at the intersection of algorithmic effectiveness and security implementation, particularly regarding systematic methodologies for empirically-derived weight optimization, standardized evaluation frameworks for travel companion systems, and practical blockchain-ML integration approaches. This research contributes novel empirically-derived hybrid matrix factorization integrated with SBT verification, establishing empirical-driven recommendation methodologies and secure authentication frameworks essential for peer-to-peer travel platforms where personal safety is paramount.

3.1.2.1 Target Demographic and Market Demand
      The respondent pool demonstrated diverse travel habits, ensuring findings are relevant to both novice and experienced travelers:
* Rarely travel solo: 10 respondents (41.7%)
* Planning their first solo trip: 7 respondents (29.2%)
* Travel solo occasionally (1-2x/year): 7 respondents (29.2%)
* Will not consider solo traveling: 2 respondents (8.3%)
      This distribution confirms strong latent demand for services facilitating shared travel experiences, validating the target demographic for WanderTogether. As for the concerns of solo traveling, the primary concern would be safety and security, followed by high costs, then sense of loneliness and lack of social interaction. A few respondents also showed concerns about logistics and planning.
      The research reveals significant user skepticism about platform security, establishing critical imperatives for trust-building mechanisms. When asked about fake profile concern levels, 70.8% answered "Very concerned", whereas 16.7% shown slight concern.
      Moreover, an overwhelming skepticism mandates that robust trust and verification systems be implemented as foundational elements, not optional features. The data reveals:
* Trust Deficit: Nearly 9 out of 10 users approach travel companion platforms with inherent distrust
* Verification Imperative: The 75% demand for government ID verification directly correlates with the 87.5% security concerns
* Platform Credibility: High skepticism levels indicate that platform success depends on demonstrable security measures
* User Retention: Security concerns could lead to platform abandonment if not adequately addressed
      These findings indicate the need for a reliable and secure platform that addresses safety concerns while enabling cost-sharing opportunities through companion matching. The prominence of safety concerns (66.7%) validates the platform's security-first approach, while cost concerns (50%) support the economic benefits of travel companion matching.
      
3.1.2.2 Security Features Demand Analysis
      When asked about the most valuable security features, respondents demonstrated clear preferences:
* Government ID verification: 18 respondents (75.0%)
* User review and rating system: 11 respondents (45.8%)
* Social media profile verification: 11 respondents (45.8%)
* In-app emergency contact/reporting: 6 respondents (25.0%)
Regarding willingness to undergo secure ID verification:
* "Yes, definitely" willing to verify: 14 respondents (58.3%)
* "Yes, but with privacy concerns": 4 respondents (16.7%)
* "Maybe, need more details": 6 respondents (25.0%)
      According to the results, 75% of the respondents demanded government ID verification and 75% willing to undergo verification, this validates blockchain-based identity verification as essential infrastructure. 

3.1.2.3 Empirical Algorithm Weight Optimization
      The research successfully identified compatibility factor priorities for machine learning algorithm optimization, providing concrete empirical data for weight distribution:
* Primary Factors (75% user priority):
o Similar budget compatibility
o Similar travel pace matching
* Secondary Factors (57% user priority):
o Shared interests alignment
o Same travel style preferences
* Minimal Factors (<10% user priority):
o Gender preferences
o Sleep schedule matching
The findings provide empirical weight distribution for hybrid matrix factorization:
W_budget = 0.75, W_pace = 0.75, W_interests = 0.57, W_style = 0.57, W_other = <0.10

3.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing
3.2.1 Data Sources
* User profiles: Structured data collected during user registration and use, including demographics (age, gender, location), travel preferences (destinations, budget, interests), and post-trip ratings.
* Blockchain records: Public wallet addresses and associated verification status from the blockchain, providing immutable proof of identity verification.
* Empirical research: Survey findings (n=24) that establish user preference weights for algorithmic optimization, security requirements for blockchain integration, and market validation for target demographic confirmation.

3.2.2 Data Preprocessing Pipeline
	To ensure the matching algorithm accurately reflects user preferences, feature engineering is guided by empirical survey results. Each profile attribute is transformed and weighted according to its validated importance:
1. Budget Compatibility: User budgets are normalized to a common scale, allowing for direct comparison. This feature receives the highest weight (0.75), reflecting its top priority among surveyed users.
2. Travel Pace Matching: Travel pace preferences are encoded and assigned the highest weight (0.75) based on user-validated importance.
3. Interest Alignment: Shared interests are captured using multi-hot encoding, enabling the algorithm to identify overlapping activities and hobbies. The weight (0.57) reflects the moderate priority found in survey responses.
4. Travel Style Compatibility: Preferences for travel style are encoded and weighted (0.57) to match the empirical significance indicated by users.
5. Minimal Demographic Factors: Attributes such as gender and sleep schedule are included with minimal weighting (<0.10), as survey data shows these factors are less influential in user matching decisions.

3.3 Machine Learning Methodology
3.3.1 Empirically-Derived Hybrid Matching System
	Based on comprehensive literature analysis and empirical user requirements, WanderTogether will adopt a hybrid matrix factorization approach as the optimal matching system. Literature demonstrates that hybrid methods achieve superior user acceptance rates (78% vs. 45-50% for single-criterion systems), excel in cold-start scenarios for new users (addressing the 70.8% new/infrequent traveler demographic), and support multi-dimensional optimization across budget, pace, interests, and style. Empirical survey data further validates this choice, revealing users prioritize multiple compatibility factors with varying weights and demand personalized recommendations (91.7% importance). The hybrid approach also enables integration of trust scores-critical given 87.5% user security concerns-and supports dynamic learning and interpretability, while remaining compatible with blockchain-based trust scoring.
	The hybrid matrix factorization system integrates content-based filtering with collaborative elements, implementing empirically-derived feature weighting based on user research findings:

Feature Vector Construction with Empirical Weights:
user_vector = [ 0.75 � normalized_budget, 0.75 � normalized_pace,
0.57 � interest_encoding, 0.57 � style_encoding, <0.10 � demographic_factors ]
Hybrid Similarity Calculation:
Hybrid_Score = a � Content_Similarity + � � Collaborative_Filter + ? � Trust_Score    (4.1)
Where:
* Content_Similarity = (A � B) / (||A|| � ||B||) with empirical weights
* Collaborative_Filter = Matrix_Factorization(User_Item_Matrix)
* Trust_Score = Database_Ratings_Average

Algorithm Process:
1. Profile Vectorization: Convert user profiles into weighted feature vectors using empirical coefficients
2. Content-Based Matching: Calculate similarity using cosine similarity with empirically-derived weights
3. Collaborative Enhancement: Apply matrix factorization to identify latent compatibility factors
4. Trust Integration: Incorporate trust scores from completed trips
5. Hybrid Scoring: Combine all components using optimized weighting parameters
6. Recommendation Generation: Rank potential matches by hybrid scores

3.4 Blockchain Implementation
      The blockchain implementation leverages free, open-source blockchain infrastructure to address the critical security and trust challenges identified in empirical research, where 87.5% of respondents prioritized security concerns. The implementation utilizes Ethereum testnets and free IPFS services to provide enterprise-grade security without operational costs, enabling MetaMask integration.

3.4.1 Identity Verification Workflow
	The identity verification process ensures that all users on the platform are genuine, leveraging blockchain technology for security and transparency. The workflow is as follows:
1. User Registration
o The user connects their MetaMask wallet and provides basic profile information
o Basic profile information (name, email, travel preferences) is collected
2. Document Submission
o Government-issued ID is encrypted client-side using AES-256 before upload to IPFS services
o IPFS CID and document hash are recorded for integrity verification
3. Smart Contract Interaction
o Verification data is stored on Ethereum for zero gas costs
o A unique SBT is minted as cryptographic proof of verification
4. Access Grant
o Frontend verifies SBT presence through smart contract queries
o Users gain incremental platform access based on verification level
5. Post-trip Rating
o Post-trip ratings are stored in the database
o Aggregated trust scores are calculated from trip completion

3.4.2 Security Features
	The blockchain implementation provides four fundamental security guarantees:
* Immutability: Verification records and trust scores cannot be retroactively altered
* Decentralization: Eliminates single points of failure and platform manipulation risks  
* Transparency: All verifications are auditable on-chain for community validation
* Cryptographic Integrity: Smart contract execution ensures bias-free trust calculations

* Data: User details, preferences, wallet addresses

4.2.2 Hybrid Matrix Factorization Matching Engine
* Algorithm: Hybrid matrix factorization integrating content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and trust scoring
* Empirical Weighting: Survey-derived coefficients (Budget: 0.75, Pace: 0.75, Interests: 0.57, Style: 0.57)

4.2.3 Blockchain Integration
* Smart Contract: Mints SBTs upon identity verification.

1. User uploads ID ? Encrypts and stores on IPFS
2. Mints SBT with IPFS hash
3. Verification status checked via SBT ownership

4.2.4 Feedback System
* Rating: 1-4 labeled scale (Bad, Neutral, Good, Very Good) post-trip.
* Impact: Updates user trust scores for future matches.

4.3 Use Case Diagram
      The use case diagram illustrates how a traveler interacts with the platform. A user can register/login, create or edit their profile, and complete blockchain-based identity verification using a wallet and SBT. The matching feature recommends compatible companions; if both parties confirm, the system reveals any contact details each user has opted to share (e.g., Instagram, phone, email, Facebook). After the trip, the user marks it as completed and submits a 1-4 labeled rating (Bad–Very Good) of their companion. There is no in-app chat; contact is made externally using the revealed details.

Figure 4.1: Simple Use Case Diagram

4.4 Sequence Diagrams
	Figure 4.1 shows the steps for a new user to become verified. The user signs up and connects their wallet via the frontend, which creates a profile in the backend database. The user then uploads an encrypted ID document to IPFS and receives a CID. The frontend calls the smart contract to record the CID and mint a soulbound verification token to the user's wallet. Finally, the backend marks the profile as verified, enabling access to features that require trust.
	Figure 4.2 describes how two users go from receiving recommendations to making contact. The user requests matches and the backend returns a ranked list based on content-based similarity. The user sends a match request to a chosen candidate; if the recipient accepts, the system marks the match as confirmed. At that moment, the backend reveals only the contact fields that each user has provided and consented to share, allowing them to communicate on external apps without any in-platform chat.
      Figure 4.3 explains how feedback is collected after a trip. Once either participant marks the trip as completed, the system prompts the user to rate their companion on a 4-level labeled scale (1=Bad, 2=Neutral, 3=Good, 4=Very Good). The rating is stored in the database against the specific trip and user pair, and may be aggregated into a trust score that influences future recommendations. This lightweight process supports accountability and improves the quality of subsequent matches.
